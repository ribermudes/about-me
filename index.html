<h3>ABOUT</h3>
<p>
  Hi! I’m Shyama (rhymes with llama). After 10 years of working in the graphic and interactive design fields I learned that I’m more into the art side of things, but I still love design when I get to incorporate my own illustrations. I’m currently based in Brooklyn, but previously lived in Austin and San Francisco. There are plenty of ways to reach me below if you’re interested in a collaboration or want to follow my work.
